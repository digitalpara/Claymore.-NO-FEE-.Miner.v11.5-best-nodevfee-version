Why? Because Claymore is taking to much fee from us and we feel thats steeling.

So thats why we created a addon that will give us back the fee

The program is easy to use just change the Bat file

sample:

EthDcrMiner64.exe -epool eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -esm 1 -ewal youre wallet adress -epsw x -eworker RIG12 -r 1 -tstop 75 -tt 65

thats all folks

Claymore No Devfee nofee

We have created and tested a No devfee for mining. This addon wil not interfere with the normal claymore functions it will only redirect the devfee to your wallet The program will add a new rig to your stats called DEFAULT this user will show you the ammount of shares per hour that you save you can do the math yourself to see how much that is in 24/7.

We do not sell this program and it is free for use. We are proud to present this option to you, We use the program ourself and run it on ethermine.org with Ethereum mining We do not know and tested it on other ethereum mining pools thats up to you to test. When we update this program we will post it here so visit us again.

If you like this program and apriciate the effort you can always donate 0.005 Ethereum or less or more what ever you think its worth. We will apriciate it and boost our moral to devellope new no dev fee programs.
